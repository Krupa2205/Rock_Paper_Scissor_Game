Rock Paper Scissor Game
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissor Game! ðŸŽ®

This is a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this project to sharpen my web development skills and have some fun along the way.

I created this game to enhance my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts like functions, conditionals, and event handling. It was a great way to practice coding while creating something fun and engaging.
